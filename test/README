IJVM Tools
----------

The Integer Java Virtual Machine is introduced in Structured Computer
Organization (Tanenbaum, 1998), section 4.  This package contains an
assembler and 

The assembler, ijvm-asm,
translates symbolic IJVM instructions into IJVM bytecode. The bytecode
produced, in turn, serves as input to the interpreter, ijvm, which
executes the bytecode and gives a detailed execution trace.

The Mic1 tools consist of an assembler for the Micro Assembly Language
(MAL) specified in Structured Computer Organization (Tanenbaum, 1998),
section 4.3.1 and an interpreter for the Mic1 microarchitechture
specified in section 4.1.

The assembler, mic1-asm, translates a MAL program into a 512 word
image for the Mic1 control store. The interpreter, mic1, loads this
control store image and optionally an IJVM bytecode file and then
simulates the Mic1 machine.
